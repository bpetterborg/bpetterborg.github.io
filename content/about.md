I'm a high school student studying software development,
data science, systems administration, and other related stuff.

What I Do:

- Build, setup, and configure servers
- Install and configure firewalls
- Manage hypervisors, and docker/k8s/rancher instances
- Create usable software
- Learn whatever technology is needed to complete a job

In my free time, I also do satellite reception,
3D printing, and other nerd stuff that you will
see here.

Thanks for reading!
