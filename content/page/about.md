Iâ€™m a high school student studying software development, data science, systems administration, and other related stuff.

What I do:

 - Build, setup, and configure servers
 - Install and configure networking equipment
 - Manage hypervisors, and docker/k8s/rancher instances
 - Create usable software
 - Learn whatever technology is needed to complete a job


In my free time, I also do satellite reception, 3D printing, and other nerdy stuff that you will see here.

Thanks for reading!
